Declarative: Declarative Pipeline encourages a Declarative Programming Model. In declarative programming, you specify what you want. You don’t care how it will get done.
Scripted: Scripted Pipelines follow a more Imperative Programming Model. In Imperative programming, you specify what you want and how it should be done.

A pipeline is a collection of steps or jobs which are interlinked with one another in a sequence.

The Jenkins Pipeline is written into a text file called a Jenkinsfile (You can use a different name) which can be committed to a project’s source control repository.
